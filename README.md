# K-Means Clustering
The primary objective is to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The features used for clustering are "Annual Income" and "Spending Score." The elbow method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).

The elbow method graphically represents the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different values of k. The "elbow" in the graph signifies the optimal value for k.

The chosen k is then used to fit the K-Means model to the data. The resulting clusters are visualized on a scatter plot, with centroids highlighted.
